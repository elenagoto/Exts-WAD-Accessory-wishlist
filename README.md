# A clothing accessory wishlist

This is the final project for the second course ("Interactive web pages") of the [**EPFL Extension School**](https://www.extensionschool.ch/)'s [_Web Application Development Program_](https://www.extensionschool.ch/web-application-development).

This project was developed by [_Laura Elena GÃ³mez_](https://github.com/elenagoto), and was sumbmitted and approved in November 2019.

## Project description and goals

This is a clothing accessory wishlist. The aim of the site is to allows visitors to view clothing accessories by category (hats, gloves, socks, and sunglasses), filter by color, and then add up to three items to their own wishlist. The wishlist can then be viewed, and items can be removed from the wishlist.
